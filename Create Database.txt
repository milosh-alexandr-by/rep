Before run application you must create MySQ database:
create database faculty;
use faculty;

In dao/src/main/resources/beans-dao.xml
change:  
       <prop key="hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto">update</prop>
     to 
       <prop key="hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto">create</prop>

Then run appllication. Hibernate will create tables in database.

Then enter data for admin navigation:
insert into role values (1, "ROLE_ADMIN");
insert into role values (2, "ROLE_STUDENT");
insert into role values (3, "ROLE_TEACHER");
insert into user (username, password, role_id) values ("admin", "admin", 1);

In order to get "Admin Page" follow this link:
localhost:8080/admin  (*for Apache Tomcat)

and enter username: admin
          password: admin

And now you can add courses.

!After STOP application:
change:  
       <prop key="hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto">create</prop>
     to 
       <prop key="hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto">update</prop>

in order to data in the database is not deleted during the next run application.
